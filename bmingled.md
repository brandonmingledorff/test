A github fork is when you make a copy of a repository, and when you make changes to it, it does not effect the original repo. It creates a link between your forked repo and the original repo that allows you to commit changes back to the original using pull requests.

A github clone is similar to a fork as it also makes a copy of a repository, but the link to the original is not present as it is in a fork. You have to be listed as a collaborator on the repo to make official changes.

A github branch is similar to the others in that it allows you to make changes to some piece of code. It is different in that it keeps the changes being made to the 'master branch' in one place rather than separated. Branches are changes that will eventually be 'merged' with the master branch.
